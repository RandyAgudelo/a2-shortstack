## Online Shopping Calculator

- This project helps the user create a shopping list where they can add and remove products as well as give the final total cost of all the products in the list
- The main challenge addressed is the user having to traditionally write down products they want to buy and calculate the costs for all their items separately 
- The problem can be addressed through the use of forms, organizing the data into a table, calculating the final costs of all the items through a function, and saving the list within the server's memory
- The results offer users the ability to create a shopping list online where they can add and remove products as they please and figure out the final cost of all their items ahead of time before going to 
  the store so that they have a rough estimate of how much all their desired products to buy together will cost
- Future work could include creating and saving multiple shopping lists at one time and being able to access a specifically saved shopping list

## Technical Achievements
- **Having 2 seperate index.html, scripts.js, and style.css files**: Created a separate webpage for the user to go to once they input all their data while also having the ability to go
back to the original page. Each of the index.html files have their own script.js files with their own functionality as well as their own style.css files.

- **Created a somewhat accessible web application**: Through the use of a web accessibility tool online, I was able to make my webpages more accessible through the use of labels and creating 
additional identification and details to certain html tags. I also checked the elements on the webpages and they have a good contrast making it easy to read the text with the given background.

- **Used custom font**: Through the use of Google custom fonts in my CSS file, I was able to give all the text a kanit font.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Created a diagonal background gradient**: Shown in `style.css`, I was able to make a diagonal gradient that uses a darker shade of coral, yellow, and light blue. 
This will give the background some flair and makes the webpage appear more interesting.

- **Hover feature and Cursor pointer change for buttons**: When the user hovers over a button with their cursor, the cursor will change and a border will appear. 
Also once the "Add Product" and "Remove Product" buttons are clicked, they will redirect the user to the shopping list and clear the entry fields so that if they return
to the original page, the fields will be blank.
